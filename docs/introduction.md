# Introduction

Alexa voice interface for Toronto Open Data.
Ask "Hey Toronto" something and it will display
on a paired web page acting as a Kiosk.

Ask Hey Torontoâ€¦

* where are Parks
* where are Parks near Yonge and Eglinton
* where are Parks near CN Tower
* where are Skating Rinks
* where are Malls
* where are Swimming Pools
* where are Parking Lots
* where are Parking Garages near me
* where are Parking Garages nearby
* where is the CN Tower
* where is the Eaton Centre

This project comes complete with source code for both the 
Alexa Skill Server, and the Web Server, and instructions
how to set up everything.

It should be straight forward to adopt this project
to other data sets and / or cities. 
Note however the project is rather sprawling, as
there&apos;s a lot of moving parts involved in making this work.

## On the Web

This project will be available under the name "Hey, Toronto"
on Alexa.  
You can run the Kiosk Web Page at
[https://hey.homestar.io](https://hey.homestar.io).
Remember you need both of these together.
